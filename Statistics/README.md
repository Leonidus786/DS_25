# Statistics

1. Descriptive Statistics - a. Measure of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode) b. Measure of Dispersion  ---> Summarizing the data
2. Inferential Statistics - A lot of things like Ztest, t test, ANOVA, CHISQUARE, HYPOTHESIS(p-values), Condfidence Intervals, Z-table, t-table,

Summarizing the data --> Histograms, pdf, cdf, Probability, permutation, variance, mean, median, mode, standard deviation

1. Gaussian Distribution
2. Log Normal Distribution
3. Binomial Distribution
4. Bernouli Distributions
5. Pareto Distributions
6. Standard Normal Distribution
7. Transformation and Standardization
8. Q-Q Plot
