# Review: 
# Create a function called greet(). 
# Write 3 print statements inside the function.
# Call the greet() function and run your code.


# Today we are going to be looking at functions that allow you to give them input
# And Once we've learned all of that and we've grasped it, then we're going to be building a cipher program.
# And the cipher game is called Caesar Cipher. So Caesar cipher is a really quite ancient type of encryption.
# So, the story goes that, When Caesar wanted to send  highly sensitive military messages, he would
# encode his message so that each letter would be shifted by a  predetermined amount.
# So let's say that we wanted to encode the letter "A" and we shift it by 3.  

# Previously we learned that functions are a really handy way of taking a complex set of instructions
# and packaging them together inside a block of code that has a name given to it.

# def  my_function():
    # Do This
    # Then do this.
    # Finally do this.

# And when we need all of the lines of code that's packaged inside this function.
#  All we have to do at any point  later on in our code is just to call the function.

# by typing name and a set of parentheses.

# my_function()

# and when this line of code is run, it's going to search for where this function is defined, which is above.
#  and then it's going to execute all lines of code that are contained within it.
# Now it's been a little while since we've seen functions.
