# Review: 
# Create a function called greet(). 
# Write 3 print statements inside the function.
# Call the greet() function and run your code.

# To create a function, we of course need a def keyword. 
# And we know it's a keyword, because as soon as we type it, changes to the blue color. 


def  greet():
    print("Hello")
